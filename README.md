# Malipo
Malipo is Swahili for Payment. Malipo App is an Android app that currently implements Fortumo carrier billing configured to Kenyan mobile operators only potentially 40 Million mobile subscribers. (To be opened up to all countries Fortumo supports).
In the near future Malipo is going to contain other types of billing developers can implement in their products to make money. With Malipo we hope to help make it easy for developers know exactly how to configure and implement the many Payments APIs they can use to charge for products or eCommerce in their apps.
